# 🏗️ Spring Boot Project Structure & Important Annotations

---

## 🧒 Imagine Building with LEGO 🧱

Think of a **Spring Boot project** like a big LEGO house.

Each **folder** is like a room in your LEGO house.
Each **Java class** is like a LEGO block that does a specific job.
Spring Boot brings everything together so the house works perfectly!

## 📂 Project Structure Overview

Here's what the typical Spring Boot project looks like:

```
my-spring-boot-app/
│
├── src/
│   └── main/
│       ├── java/
│       │   └── com/example/demo/
│       │       ├── DemoApplication.java        --> 🧠 Main Door (Entry Point)
│       │       ├── controller/
│       │       ├── service/
│       │       └── repository/
│       └── resources/
│           ├── application.properties          --> ⚙️ Settings Room
│           └── static/, templates/             --> 🌐 Website Stuff
│
├── pom.xml or build.gradle                     --> 📦 Toolbox (Dependencies)
```

### 🧠 Let's Understand Each Part

| Part | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `DemoApplication.java` | The **main class** with a `main()` method. It's the starting point of the app — like the front door! 🚪 |
| `controller/` | Tells the app what to do when someone knocks (like a browser request). Think of it as the **reception desk**! |
| `service/` | Where the real thinking happens. It’s your **worker room** that handles logic. |
| `repository/` | Talks to the database. Like the **library** of your app that stores and finds stuff. |
| `resources/application.properties` | Your app’s **notebook** for writing settings like port number, database URL, etc. |
| `static/` and `templates/` | Hold web pages and assets like HTML, CSS, JS. Like **decoration rooms** for the house. |

## 🏷️ Important Annotations (Spring’s Magic Stick 🪄)

Spring Boot uses special **@annotations**. Think of them like putting stickers on your LEGO bricks to say what they do!

| Annotation | What It Means |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| `@SpringBootApplication` | 🚪 “Hey Spring, this is the starting point of my app!” |
| `@RestController` | 🧍‍♂️ “I'm the one who handles the web calls.” |
| `@GetMapping("/hello")` | 🗣️ “If someone visits `/hello`, I’ll respond.” |
| `@Service` | 🧠 “I think and do the main work!” |
| `@Repository` | 📚 “I save or find things in the database.” |
| `@Autowired` | 🧲 “Spring, please give me this helper automatically!” |

---

## 🎉 Let’s See a Simple Flow

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args); // 🚪 App starts here
    }
}
```

```java
@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hi, I'm working! 👋";
    }
}
```

When someone visits `localhost:8080/hello` in the browser, they'll see:

```
Hi, I'm working! 👋
```

---

## ✅ Summary

- A Spring Boot project has different **folders**, like rooms in a LEGO house.
- Each folder has its own job: **controller** talks to the user, **service** does work, and **repository** talks to the database.
- Spring uses **@annotations** to magically manage everything for you!
